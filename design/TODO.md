# TODO

* Make diagram of at least 3 hexagons by 6 hexagons with (x, y) coords so I can understand how cursor movement should work.
    should it actually be a lookup table instead of code?
    mention it in a comment in the code, since it seems like it will always be confusing.


* Make cursor that can instantly swap pieces
    select one, then pick another one and they then swap

* make swapping animated
    allow selecting others while animations are going on, but not ones that are moving.

* when matching halves line up, remove the hex from the board

* make hexes fall to fill space left by missing hexes
    explore falling in unconventional directions. Maybe towards center?

* generate solvable puzzles where the goal is to eliminate all the hexes
