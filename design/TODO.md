# TODO

* draw each half separately, with different colours to the other half

* Make cursor that can instantly swap pieces
    select one, then pick another one and they then swap

* make swapping animated
    allow selecting others while animations are going on, but not ones that are moving.

* when matching halves line up, remove the hex from the board

* make hexes fall to fill space left by missing hexes
    explore falling in unconventional directions. Maybe towards center?

* generate solvable puzzles where the goal is to eliminate all the hexes
